Prince County
 <LINE> <LINE>
The westernmost county of the island, Prince County is itself naturally divided into three distinct sub-regions. The narrow isthmus on the eastern end of the county is home to the second largest city on the island, Summerside. And just east of that is the industrial hub of Kensington. The towns of Alberton and Tignish are located on the western end of the county.
