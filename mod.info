description=Lost Province is a massive standalone map fully re-creating the island province of Prince Edward Island in Canada. Every city and town on the island has been faithfully re-created in high detail. Set in the days following the global spread of the Knox Event infection, the residents thought being on an island would spare them from the horror unfolding across the globe. They were not special, they were not spared. This tranquel island, once the birthplace of confederation, the garden of the gulf, now just another... Lost Province.
